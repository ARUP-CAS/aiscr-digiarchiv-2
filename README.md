# Digital Archive of the AMCR 2.x
The Digital Archive of the Archaeological Map of the Czech Republic (AMCR) is a web application designed to browse information on archaeological research, sites and finds, operated by the Institutes of Archaeology of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague and Brno. The archives of these institutions contain documentation of archaeological fiedwork in the Czech territory from 1919 to the present day and further enrich their collections. The AMCR database and related documents form the largest collection of archaeological data concerning Czechia, it is therefore an important part of our cultural heritage.

The AMCR Digital Archive contains various kinds of records - individual archaeological documents (texts, field photographs, aerial images, maps and plans, digital data), projects, fieldwork events, archaeological sites, record of individual finds as well as a library of 3D models. Data and descriptive attributes are continuously provided by the AMCR, with which the Digital Archive is also linked by user accounts.

The data contained in the Digital Archive shall be published in accordance with an open access policy and with the consent of copyright holders - relevant professional institutions. Most of the data is accessible to any user, the documents are usually available after the user's account is registered, and a smaller part of the data only serves experts from authorised archaeological organisations. Hundreds of thousands of documents and records are gradually being prepared for publication. Their publications are announced by the information in the home menu and the News section.

The Digital Archive is part of the Archaeological Information System of the Czech Republic (AIS CR) listed in the Roadmap of Large Research Infrastructures of the Czech Republic. The operation of AIS CR has long been supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports, as well as European Union resources. Infrastructure also receives additional support under the Strategy AV21 programme of the Czech Academy of Sciences and individual domestic and international grant projects.

Digital Archive 2.x is an enhanced version of the previous AMCR Digital Archive web application.
